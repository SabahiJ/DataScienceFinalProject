# Financial Sentiment Trend Prediction Tool

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project explores whether financial news sentiment can serve as a predictive signal for short-term stock price movement, using Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) as a case study. By leveraging FinBERT â€” a transformer-based NLP model fine-tuned on financial text â€” the project extracts sentiment from news headlines and compares these predictions against actual market movement and human-annotated labels.

The tool was developed as part of a final-year undergraduate project in Data Science at the University of Westminster. The repository contains all source code, cleaned datasets, visualisations, and evaluation outputs

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Collect sentiment-relevant news headlines about Nvidia using NewsAPI
- Clean and preprocess financial headlines for NLP analysis
- Apply FinBERT to classify sentiment as bullish, bearish, or neutral
- Merge sentiment data with stock price data to evaluate prediction accuracy
- Manually label a sample of headlines to benchmark FinBERTâ€™s performance
- Generate visual insights and evaluate both model and real-world alignment
